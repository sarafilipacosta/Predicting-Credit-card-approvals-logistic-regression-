# what is used in this project
In this project is used many, like get_dummies to convert non-numeric data to numeric (one hot encoding), MinMaxScaler to scale features to a range of 0 and 1, and logistic regression and confusion matrix techniques to predict the proportion of correct classifications and model performance. And in order to get the ideal values for the given parameters, we have used grid searching.

# Project description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

# Project tasks
1- Read Credit card applications
2- Inspecting the applications

5- Preprocessing the data
  5.1- Convert non-numeric data (categorical) into numeric
  5.2- Segregate features and labels for training and testing
  5.3- Scale the feature values to a uniform range
6- Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
7- Making predictions and evaluating performance
